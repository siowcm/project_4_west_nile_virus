This finding suggests that there may be more barriers to dissemination and infection of the salivary glands in Cx. pipiens than in Cx. restuans.)\n",

If possible, drone technology can be used to track mosquito growth and spray mosquitoes.\n",

There is also a two weeks lag between mosquito growth and virus transmission (EDA). As a result, the spraying cycle can be aligned with the mosquito growth cycle in order to maximize results."

According to NCBI, these meterological factors are more favourable for mosquito growth rate <sup>[3](\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342965/\")</sup>.
