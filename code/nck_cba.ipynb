The government should prioritize spraying neighborhoods with a higher incidence of Culex restuans, followed by Culex Pipiens. If possible, drone technology can be used to spray mosquitoes, because they complete the same task for 10-15% of the price of a helicopter.<sup>[3](https://energycentral.com/c/pip/drone-vs-helicopters-%E2%80%93-utility-inspections).</sup>\n",

There is also a two weeks lag between mosquito growth and virus transmission (EDA). As a result, the spraying cycle can be aligned with the mosquito growth cycle in order to maximize results - consult the relevant experts for more details on how to implement this strategy."

Moving forward, summer temperatures are expected to increase because of global warming, and more extreme weather conditions are expected (eg. extreme changes between daily precipitation rate). According to NCBI, these meterological factors are more favourable for mosquito growth rate <sup>[5](\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342965/\")</sup>. CDC should take these factors into account when crafting a strategy in order to best tackle this virus, and account for the cost increase per year in controlling mosquito populations in their budget."
